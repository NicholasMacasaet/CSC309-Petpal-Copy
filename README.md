## CSC309 Class Project 

Group Number: 3772 


## Project Description
This project for our CSC309 Programming on the Web class is meant to showcase our skills that we have learned throughout the course.
From a static webpage all the way to a React frontend, each component of the project was build from scratch by me and my group 
This project is meant to be a mock pet finder app to connect pet seeker to pet shelter. 


## Key features
In this application, users will be able to sign up as a shelter or pet seeker. 
Shelters can create listings for pets, advertise their shelter, and respond to applications.
Seekers can search for shelters as well as pet listings, apply to adopt a pet, communicate with the shelter on the adoption status of said pet, and leave reviews on the shelter


## My responsibilities
My responsibilities during the duration of this project comprised of creating the review and messaging features and creating the end-user interface for login and registration. I was also partially responsible for creation of the initial Figma mockup
